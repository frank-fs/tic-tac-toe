# SP3 Seating & Conduct — Findings and Apparatus State

_2026-07-01, branch sp3-redux. Model held constant: `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` (OpenRouter)._

## Apparatus (validated this session)

- **3-agent staggered runs.** Server seats by **claim-on-first-successful-move**; the 3rd
  identity → 403 observer. Identity = per-process cookie jar (distinct seats). Solo/1-seat
  runs are INVALID (prior session's confound) — not identity collapse.
- **Fully-fixed binary:** seating fix (`5892849`) + post-game gate (`518b82d`).
- **Transcript capture** (`TRANSCRIPT_PATH`) + **behavior coder** (`code` subcommand, `98705d5`).
- Pipeline: `arena.sh up <CELL>` → 3 staggered drivers (`--coldstart`, plain|browser prompt)
  → per-seat transcript + proxy http log + server game-events → `code` → `conduct_ratio`.

## Root-cause fixes

1. **A=1 was un-bootstrappable.** Surface `callerRole` dropped the Proto reference
   (`src/TicTacToe.Web` `resolveViewer`) unseated-claims-current-turn branch, so an unseated
   visitor saw no move form → could not claim a seat. Every A=1/no-discovery run stalled with
   0 seats. Fixed: render the claimable board to an unseated caller on the current turn.
2. **Post-game replay contamination.** Agents finished a game then POSTed `/delete` + `/arenas`
   to create a replacement whose moves polluted counts (two `game_over`, seated>2). Gated:
   render no controls on a terminal arena; `deleteArena`/`restartArena` return 409.
3. **"Sd (discovery) rescues A=1" was a BUG ARTIFACT.** Pre-fix, only Sd (`/profile`) or the
   naive A=0 board could bootstrap. Post-fix, A=1 self-seats via render; **discovery is
   additive, not a bootstrap necessity** (1000/1100 complete with 0 `/profile` fetches).

## Findings — HONEST STATE (n=1, not conclusive)

Clean ladder, 10 conditions (5 cells × plain/browser), 1 run each. Seated-player conduct
(FOLLOW / (FOLLOW+INVENT)) and completion:

| cell | prompt  | X    | O    | completed | observer  |
|------|---------|------|------|-----------|-----------|
| 0000 | plain   | 0.75 | 0.50 | x_wins    | mixed     |
| 0000 | browser | 0.80 | 0.67 | —         | mixed     |
| 1000 | plain   | 0.56 | 0.05 | draw      | mixed     |
| 1000 | browser | 1.00 | 0.71 | draw      | api-client|
| 1010 | plain   | 0.75 | 0.50 | x_wins    | api-client|
| 1010 | browser | 0.50 | 0.40 | —         | mixed     |
| 1100 | plain   | 0.70 | 0.78 | x_wins    | api-client|
| 1100 | browser | 0.80 | 0.75 | x_wins    | api-client|
| 1111 | plain   | 0.40 | 0.23 | —         | api-client|
| 1111 | browser | 0.22 | 0.27 | —         | api-client|

- **n=1 variance dominates.** Plain-vs-browser and per-cell conduct effects are NOT
  separable from haiku stochasticity. No conduct claim is supported yet.
- **The earlier "browser is cleaner / completes more" impression was partly replay
  contamination.** On clean, gated data, **plain completed 4/5 cells, browser 2/5.** Browser
  does not clearly win. `conduct_ratio` diverges from completion (1000-plain O=0.05 api-client,
  game still drew).
- **Tentative:** 1111 (full surface, all layers) had the **lowest conduct AND no completion**
  for both prompts — possible semantic-overload (more surface invites exploration/guessing over
  playing the form). Needs replication.
- **Robust structural signals** (hold across cells, not n-sensitive):
  - the **observer (unseatable 3rd) always devolves to api-client / low-mixed** — no seat to
    follow → it guesses;
  - self-reported `positionTokenSource="board"` is **unreliable** — claimed even by seats that
    heavily invent (self-report ≠ observed conduct).

## Next (not run — pending decision)

- **Replication n≥5 per condition** is required before ANY conduct claim. Sharpest contrasts:
  1000 (A only) and 1111 (full surface) × plain/browser.
- Consider whether full-surface degrades conduct (the 1111 signal).
- Coder refinements available: INVENT_PATH vs INVENT_PARAM breakdown, `--llm-judge` for WAIT.

## Reproduce

Runners in the session scratchpad (`run-ladder-clean.sh`, `code-ladder.sh`). Per condition:
`CELL=<c> arena.sh up surface`; 3 drivers with `--coldstart --game <id> --route arenas`,
`COLDSTART_PROMPT_PATH` = plain or `coldstart-browser-prompt.md`, `TRANSCRIPT_PATH` set;
then `code --transcript <seat>.transcript.jsonl --role X|O`.
